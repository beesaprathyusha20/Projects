To understand the data better we created visualizations using python.
We appiled feature engineering and PCA to reduce the dimensionality and complexity to the features of the data.
Split the data into training and testing data
Appiled various machine learning algorithms and we came to conclusion that Decision Tree, Random Forest giving best results and accuracy.
