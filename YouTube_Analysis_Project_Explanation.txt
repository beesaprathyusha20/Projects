First I started the project by creating an YouTube API key which is the 
credential to access youtube data

I used Jupyter Notebook to write my python code.

The project is divided into two parts.

First part of the project deals with the channel details such as
youtube channel name, total no of subscribers, total views and total number
of videos posted by each channel.

Here I used few Data Analysts channels to compare these channel data with each other
and gain some insights by creating some basic visualizations using python seaborn libraries.

In second part of the project I extracted specific chaneel videos details such as
video title, total views of the video, each video likes and comments.

Then analyzed this data by loading into a pandas dataframe and finally visualized the data using
seaborn python library.
